                <td>The BMW 5 Series is an executive car manufactured by BMW since 1972.
                    It is the successor to the New Class Sedans and is currently in its seventh generation.

                    Initially, the 5 Series was only available in a sedan body style. The wagon/estate body style
                    (called "Touring") was added in 1991 and the 5-door fastback (called "Gran Turismo") was produced
                    from 2009 to 2017.

                    The first generation of 5 Series was powered by naturally aspirated four-cylinder and six-cylinder
                    petrol engines. Following generations have been powered by four-cylinder, six-cylinder, V8 and V10
                    engines that are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged.
                    Since 1982, diesel engines have been included in the 5 Series range.</td>
